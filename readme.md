### README.md

Sorry this repo is a little overdue. As I noted in the previous test repo--
I've been some issues with the billing on my Github
acct and cannot create new repos the conventional way at this time; however,
I've  I can still create new repos remotely  using the github.api.
(https://api.github.com/). The task for this project are as described below.

### The Tasks
In the folder there are two files in the comps folder to code
up, they are Article and Tile.

## Instructions for the tasks
There are a few things to do:
* Create a repo in github or bitbucket to do your work in.
* Use the spec sheet in the comps folder for details.
* Create a tag after I've developed for 1hr called 1hr.
* When finished I will provide a link to the repo.

In the Folder there are several assets that are needed for different tasks.
There is text to enter and images to use. Image placement doesn't matter.
I used the litte Ipsum(the lorem ipsum generator for the mac (available at
http://dustinsenos.com/littleIpsum and it the macOS/OS X app store).
The font used, open sans, is a google font that can be found here:
 https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans.

I'm coding this app as though it were an enterprise-level development project;
Taking into consideration maintainability, sharability, and footprint.
Initial load as well as overall page size is important.

## Get Cracking!
